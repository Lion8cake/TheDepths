=========================================
Depths version 0.7.0
Please report any bugs to our discord: https://discord.gg/JwEKrVhjA6
Worlds can be converted from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4 just by opening them

The Depths is an alternate version of the underworld similar to how crimson corruption works. It generates instead of the underworld to give some of your worlds that bit of spice when starting a new playthrough.
This mod is made by the same devs behind the confection mod, a mod similar to this one but for the hallow. This biome and most of its sprites and ideas come from Snickerbobble and her forum post talking about her take on an alternate hell.

This mod has Achievement Mod Support, download and use the Achievement Mod to see achievements for this mod
This mod has Fargo's Best of Both World Support, When enabled you can now have both the confection and the hallow infect normal worlds
