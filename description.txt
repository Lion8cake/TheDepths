The Depths (Alternate Hell)
=========================================
Depths version 1.0.5.3 (v2025.09 port hotfix)
Welcome to THE DEPTHS 
The Depths is a mod that adds an alternate biome to the underworld called the depths, this works very similar to how the crimson and corruption works in the base game. 
This mod fully replaces all content found within the underworld from the lava cavern layer to the wall of flesh; everything has an alternative!
The depths' biome is a cold, dark deeper cave filled with shale, mercury and lots of gems. It contains a whole new liquid and a new boss and way of unlocking hardmode

The Depths was originally a concept made back in 2015 by Snickerbobble that contained sprites and very well made concepts for a lot of the depths' content. In august of 2021 this project would be picked up by Lion8cake and be worked on ever since to bring a fully working hell alternate to terraria/tModLoader.
The team behind the Depths has also made a similar yet incomplete mod called the Confection REBAKED, it does a very similar thing to the Depths but replaces the Hallow instead of the underworld.

This mod contains some mod support features, the supported mods are below
Fargo's Best of Both Worlds - download and use Fargo's BoBW, this allows for the creation of dual core worlds without the use of a drunk seed
Music Display - download and use the Music Display mod to see the track names and authors for each of the depths' music
Boss Checklist - download and use Boss Checklist to see the alternate wall of flesh and where and how to fight her

Biome Lava support is unfortunately unavaliable as of 1.0.3.0. This support may return in furture updates.

Various notes:
Drunk seed allows for you to use both the Depths and Underworld if entirely replacing a biome is not your thing
Full Don't dig up and other seed support for any playthrough you might enjoy
This mod contains various systems that allow for dynamic support with Modded Items, NPCs, Bosses and more allowing for most mods to be automatically compatible
This mod adds 4 new achievements to collect on your journey while exploring the vast underground
Custom world icons will display which worlds are Depths and underworlds
Full controller support - if your mouse is broken, fear not you can play on a console controller
Full Multiplayer support - feel free to dig deep alongside your friends
