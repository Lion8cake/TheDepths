# The Depths - Alternate Hell
The Depths is a small Terraria/tModLoader content mod that adds various content to the later states of pre-hardmode to the early hardmode area of the game. 

The Depths mod adds a singular biome to Terraria
This biome is called the Depths and replaces the underworld with a 50/50 chance or whether the depths is selected in the world creation screen
The Depths biome is a cold deeper cave made up of shale, arquerite, quartz, quicksilver and a whole lot of gems
Its home to a fierce beast which beating unlocks hardmode similar to Terraria's Wall of Flesh boss
This mod comprises several edits to the base game, some never seen before in modding.
